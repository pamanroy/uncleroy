This marks the 8<sup>th</sup> book by Keigo Higashino that I've explored. I read the Indonesian version titled "Tragedi Pedang Keadilan" published by [Gramedia Pustaka Utama](https://gpu.id/) in early 2024.

## Storyline

The story follows a single father, Nagamine Shigeki who lives with his only teenage daughter in Tokyo. One night, his daughter goes to a festival but never comes home. The following day, the police arrives to deliver the heartbreaking news that his daughter had been discovered lifeless, floating in a river.

Several days later, Nagamine receives an anonymous call disclosing the names and addresses of the perpetrators. He visits the apartment from the specified address and discovers a video depicting two underage blokes drugged and abused his daughter.

As he prepares to leave through the window, Nagamine hears the sound of the door unlocking. Upon realizing that he is confronting one of the individuals from the video, Nagamine mercilessly stabs him to death.

The story progresses as Nagamine travels to Nagano to seek revenge against the remaining perpetrators, guided by information provided in anonymous calls. Subsequently, he writes a lengthy letter to the police, specifically highlighting the deficiencies of Japanese juvenile law in defending the victims of underage criminals.

He also elucidates the circumstances surrounding his actions against the boy in the apartment and asserts his determination to pursue justice until he confronts the second perpetrator in a similar manner.
