I build this wedding invitation page using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). To collect guests' heartfelt messages for the bride and groom, I integrated [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). I intentionally avoided incorporating excessive animations or autoplaying music, as I find these elements irritating in invitations received from friends.

I dubbed it `` `folklore-invitation` ``, taking cues from Taylor Swift's album "folklore." The background image and font capture a similar mood, hence the name choice.
